# AI Language Translation (Voice-Based) 🌍🗣️

## 📚 Project Description

The **AI Language Translation (Voice-Based)** system allows users to speak in one language and hear the translated version in another. It uses speech recognition to convert spoken input into text, translates it using an AI-based translator, and then outputs the translated speech using text-to-speech synthesis.

This project provides an interactive way to break language barriers and is useful for travelers, students, and multilingual communication.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **speech_recognition** – for capturing and recognizing voice input
- **googletrans** – for language translation
- **pyttsx3** – for text-to-speech synthesis
- **pyaudio** – to access the microphone
- **Tkinter** (optional) – for GUI interface
